          off the next smallest debt.
        </h3>

          Method # 2 - Avalanche method - start with paying off the largest
          debt, and once that debt is paid off, add your minimum payment to pay
          off the next largest debt.
        </h3>

          Method # 3 - Highest Interest method - start with paying off the debt
          with the highest interest rate, which saves you long term on interest
          costs. Once that debt is paid off, apply that minimum payment to help
          pay off the debt with the next highest interest rate.
